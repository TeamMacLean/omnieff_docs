## About OmniEff

OmniEff is a Snakemake-based bioinformatics pipeline developed for predicting effector proteins from genomic assemblies.

### Pipeline Origin

This pipeline is derived from the [Predector pipeline](https://github.com/ccdmb/predector), which provides a comprehensive framework for effector prediction. OmniEff adapts and extends this approach for use on HPC systems.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Integrates 10+ prediction tools for signal peptides, subcellular localization, and effector identification
- **Custom Scoring**: Implements a weighted scoring algorithm to rank candidate effectors
- **PFAM Domain Analysis**: Uses 305 curated PFAM domains associated with pathogenicity
- **HPC Optimized**: Designed for SLURM-based HPC systems with Singularity container support

### Tools Integrated

The pipeline incorporates the following bioinformatics tools:

- SignalP (v3, v4, v5, v6)
- EffectorP (v1, v2, v3)
- DeepRedEff
- LOCALIZER
- ApoplastP
- TargetP
- TMHMM
- Phobius
- HMMER (for PFAM scanning)

### Development

Developed by the Bioinformatics team at The Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL).
